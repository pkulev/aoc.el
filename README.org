#+TITLE: aoc.el -- Advent of Code private leaderboard client

* Installation

** Via =use-package=
   #+begin_src elisp
     (use-package aoc
       :ensure nil
       :quelpa
       (aoc :repo "pkulev/aoc.el"
            :fetcher github :upgrade t)
       :custom
       (aoc-private-leaderboard-id "<LEADERBOARD-ID>" "Get this from leaderboard URL.")
       (aoc-user-session-id "<SESSION-ID>" "Get this from request cookies in browser."))
   #+end_src

* Customization
  Customizable variables are subject for change so, *TODO TBA* here.

  - =aoc-user-session-id= :: /Session ID./

    Session ID that appears in cookies after authentication on https://adventofcode.com.

  - =aoc-private-leaderboard-id= :: /ID for current leaderboard./

    Multiple boards are planned too, but now only one is supported.

  - =aoc-private-leaderboard-url= :: /Private leaderboard URL template./

    You probably should not touch it.

  - =aoc-private-leaderboard-year= :: /Year for leaderboard./

    It's not ideal, tell me better way.

  - =aoc-private-request-interval= :: /Request interval (author asks to keep 15min interval)./

    Will be used for updates by timer and tracking manual updates (TODO caching).
